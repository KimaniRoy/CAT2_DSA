Q2: Key Differences Between Arrays and Linked Lists
Arrays and linked lists serve as fundamental data structures, but they differ in how they manage memory, access elements, and handle insertions and deletions. Below is a breakdown of their key distinctions.

1. Memory Management
Arrays:
Memory is allocated in a single contiguous block.

The size of an array is fixed upon creation, meaning resizing typically requires creating a new array and copying elements.

Linked Lists:
Memory is allocated dynamically, with each node stored separately in memory.

Nodes are connected via pointers, allowing flexibility in size without requiring contiguous memory.

2. Access and Performance
Arrays:
Fast Access – Elements can be accessed in constant time O(1) using an index.

Slow Modifications – Inserting or deleting elements requires shifting elements, leading to a worst-case time complexity of O(n).

Linked Lists:
Slower Access – Accessing an element requires traversing from the head, leading to O(n) time complexity for random access.

Efficient Insertions & Deletions – Operations at the start of the list are O(1), while modifications elsewhere depend on traversal time.

3. Handling Insertions and Deletions
Arrays:
Insertion: Adding an element (especially in the middle) requires shifting elements, making it less efficient.

Deletion: Removing an element involves shifting elements to maintain order, increasing operation cost.

Linked Lists:
Insertion: Inserting at the beginning is O(1), while adding elsewhere requires traversal, making it O(n) in the worst case.

Deletion: Removing the first node is O(1), but deleting from the middle or end requires finding the previous node (O(n)).

Final Thoughts
Arrays provide rapid random access due to contiguous memory but struggle with frequent modifications. Linked lists, on the other hand, excel in dynamic insertions and deletions at the cost of slower access times. Choosing between them depends on whether your application prioritizes fast lookups or flexible modifications.
