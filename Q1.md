Q1: Understanding Big O Notation in Algorithm Analysis
Big O notation is a mathematical tool used to describe how an algorithm’s time or space complexity scales with input size. It helps compare algorithm efficiency by focusing on the upper bound of their growth rate.

Key Concepts & Examples
1. Ignoring Constants
In complexity analysis, constant factors are not considered since they do not affect long-term growth.

Example:

An algorithm running in 5n time is still classified as O(n), as the constant factor 5 is insignificant for large inputs.

2. Considering Only the Most Significant Term
When multiple terms exist in an expression, the one with the highest growth rate dominates.

Example:

An algorithm with complexity n² + n is simplified to O(n²), since n² grows significantly faster than n as n increases.

3. Worst-Case Scenario Analysis
Big O primarily evaluates the worst-case performance to ensure efficiency under maximum load.

Example:

In linear search, even though the best case is O(1), the worst case (when searching for a missing element) is O(n).

4. Comparing Algorithm Efficiency
By focusing on dominant terms, Big O helps in benchmarking different algorithms.

Example:

An algorithm with O(n log n) complexity is generally more efficient than an O(n²) algorithm for large inputs.

5. Asymptotic Growth and Practical Use
Big O notation simplifies algorithm comparison by focusing on scalability rather than hardware-dependent execution times.

It allows developers to make informed choices when optimizing code for performance.

Conclusion
Big O notation provides a standardized way to evaluate and compare algorithm performance, ensuring efficiency even as input sizes grow. It emphasizes worst-case behavior and helps in selecting the most scalable solution for a given problem.
